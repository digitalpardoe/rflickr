# rFlickr

To use this version of rFlickr, first you will need to install
the RubyGem using the following command:

    $ sudo gem install digitalpardoe-rflickr

Then you'll need to get a Flickr API key as detailed here:

[http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html)

You'll need to authorize your application's API key from each
Flickr user account which wants to use it.

A short guide to get you started can be found here:

[http://digitalpardoe.co.uk/blog/show/87](http://digitalpardoe.co.uk/blog/show/87)

The guide is a little out of date in it's gem installation technique,
use the instructions above instead.

This project is still a work in progress, bear with me whilst it is
set up.
