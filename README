First you'll need to run 'ruby setup.rb' to install rflickr to your
library directory or if you're using gems, 'gem install rflickr --remote'.
If installing on Unix, this will probably need to be done as root.

Once you've got it installed, there are a few example applications in the
samples directory.  You need to first get an API key as detailed here:

http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html

You'll need to authorize your application's API key
from each account which wants to use it.

Here is a sample you can use to get started:

  flickr = Flickr.new(token_cache_file,MY_APPLICATION_KEY,MY_SHARED_SECRET)
  unless flickr.auth.token
    flickr.auth.getFrob
    url = @flickr.auth.login_link
    puts "You must visit #{url} to authorize this application.  Press enter"+
     " when you have done so. This is the only time you will have to do this."
    gets
    flickr.auth.getToken
    flickr.auth.cache_token
  end

  <... do flickr stuff now ...>

The general idea is that once you cache the token, the user will not
have to reauthorize your application unless the file where the token
is cached (the first argument to the new method on Flickr) is deleted.
When you create a new Flickr and pass in a file path to the cached
token, the API will attempt to load the token from the file. If found
and loaded, the Flickr instance's auth.token is present. If the token
could not be found in the file specified, then the instance's
auth.token will be nil, and you will have to have the user authorize
the application before it can be used.

For convenience, you can set your API_KEY and SHARED_SECRETE in the
installed version of flickr/base.rb rather than including it in every
application.
